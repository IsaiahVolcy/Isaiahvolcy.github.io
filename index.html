<h2> Stop the Hate against AAPI </h2>
<p> The Helping Hands community or HHC is currently helping the asian community as they face<br>
assults and verbal harrasment due to their race. Asaian have also been one of the hardest hit<br>
demographics due to covid-19. In the latest case of racism against asian amaericans and pacific<br> islanders,
a shooting took place in our hometown Atlanta Georgia right under our noses and<br> took the life of some of our asain
amaerican and latina community members. The shooter targeted<br> people of asian deccent and was caught
on his way to Flordia to contunue his rampage and<br> shoot other similar massage parlors. We must stand strong
and together against such hate<br> if we are to take it on.Thats why the Helping Hands Community is having a fundraiser
to increase <br>security and awareness around our asain comminuties to ensure incidents like this occur less<br> frequenctly
if at all. Please support the cause.</p>
